        I'm a final-year Computer Science student at Techno India NJR, Udaipur, focused on building scalable, admin-first web platforms. I specialize in modular architecture, secure workflows, and audit-friendly systems that solve real-world problems. My development philosophy blends backend precision with frontend clarity, and I approach every project with a product mindset — balancing technical rigor with usability and resilience.
